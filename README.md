## 🔥 About Bugify
Bugify is an Arabic-focused vulnerability coordination and bug bounty platform designed to support:
- Ethical hackers in the Arab world
- Companies seeking security improvements
- A safer and more connected cybersecurity ecosystem

The platform aims to provide an organized, secure, and efficient way for reporting vulnerabilities and rewarding ethical contributions.

## 💡 Idea Behind the Project
I’m Hamdan , a 17-year-old Emirati student passionate about ethical hacking, programming, and cybersecurity.

I noticed a big gap in the Arab world for a platform dedicated to bug bounty and vulnerability coordination.  
This inspired the creation of **Bugify** — a platform designed for our region, our language, and our community.

## 🚀 Project Vision
- Build a safe space for vulnerability reporting  
- Support UAE & Arab cybersecurity talent  
- Create a modern web platform for bug bounty programs  
- Strengthen the region’s digital security  

## 🧱 Current Status
- Domain purchased: **bugify.net**
- Frontend prototype built
- Public “Coming Soon” page live
- Backend development planned (user auth, reports, dashboards, etc.)

## 📈 Why Bugify Can Succeed
- Huge cybersecurity talent pool in the Arab world  
- Increasing demand for security awareness in companies  
- No strong Arabic platform in this domain yet  
- Clear and impactful value for both sides  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Current)
- HTML / CSS / JS
- React + Vite (Prototype)
- Netlify Deployment
